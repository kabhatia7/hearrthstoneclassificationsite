      <description>Background:
Hearthstone is a massively popular online collectible card game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. Players select a hero from one of ten classes. All classes have unique cards and abilities, known as hero powers, which help define class archetypes. Each player uses a deck of cards from their collection with the end goal being to reduce the opponent&amp;rsquo;s health to zero. Blizzard releases expansions of additional cards every four months to increase the variety in the metagame.</description>
